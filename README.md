# CyberStorm
CyberStorm is a problem solving competition at Louisiana Tech University which is done by the students taking CSC 442 - Introduction to Cyber Security.
In the class, we were divided into groups and then developed these programs that we used to solve the challenges in the competition. The team that I was apart of earned second place overall in the competition. Below, I will break down some of the programs and describe them briefly.
